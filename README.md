# EUROSEM Readme. 
The EUROSEM model was developed during the late 1980s and 1990s with funding from the EUROPEAM Commission. The code in this repository was last worked on in 1998 and compiled to run on a Lahey compiler.  The documetation and user guide in this repository describes the model'e operating equations and its operation.  Subsequently Lorenzo Borselli worked on a Pascal version of the model and currently an executable of this version is available from his personal website.
